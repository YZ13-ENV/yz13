Hi, im a YZ13, im a frontend developer and i launch my lab, where i can post and show my projects and ideas.
This site is gonna be in english, because i want to improve my language skills.

# Design

I love total black designs, so i picked black and white as the main colors, and different color than usual for errors and warnings(you can see them on [design page](/yz13/brand)).

<figure>
  <img className="rounded-xl" src="/event/launch-yz13-space/1.png" />
  <figurecation className="w-full py-3 flex items-center justify-center">
    <span className="text-center text-sm text-secondary">
